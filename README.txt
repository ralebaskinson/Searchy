Searchy v0.1 by Rale Baskinson - ralebaskinson@gmail.com
(You should probably turn on word wrap now if it isn't already enabled).
Searchy is a simple and portable application which allows you to quickly search for information online. It runs in the background and (by default) is summoned by Ctrl+Space.

How to use Searchy:
Searchy is made to be very minimilastic. When first started, it just displays an icon in the taskbar (which can, of course, be turned off). By pressing Ctrl+Space, you can bring up Searchy in the top-left corner of your screen. It then waits for your input as to what websites to search. The following are included by default:
1) a - Answers.com
2) g - Google
3) w - Wikipedia
4) y - Youtube
Searchy searches for your query using the specified website. You can choose which browser is used when searching.

There are two ways to search for something:
1) Select the text you want to search for. Summon Searchy and then type the input for the relevant website and press enter.
2) Summon Searchy and then type the input for the relevant website. Then add a space and type the query you want to search for.

You can also use 'this' (without quotes) to refer to the selected text, e.g. if you select the word 'Searchy' (without quotes) and then type 'g this source', Searchy will search Google for the query 'Searchy source'. Inputs are not case-sensitive.

Special searches:
There are 2 special searches: 'go', which simply opens the selected/specified URL, and '' (blank) which searches Google Dictionary for the query. The definition for the query is displayed in a popup, bypassing the need for the browser. Note that if you want to search for non-selected text using Google Dictionary, simply summon Searchy and put space as the first query (e.g. ' application' will search Google Dictionary for the word 'application').

Adding an input:
To add an input, go to the website you want to add and search for 'TEST' (without quotes, all caps). Then, you can add the input by opening the settings (either right-click on the tray icon, or the Searchy window after it is summoned) and then clicking the '+' button. Enter the input you want, and copy and paste the URL for the output. You can also select the URL, summon Searchy, and then type the input that you want to assign to the website. Searchy will then ask you if you want to add the input with the selected URL as the output, and click OK. (Note: Searchy will not ask this if the settings window is open).
Searchy can also be used to run a specific file/folder, and you can add and input for that using the same method.

Quasimodal mode:
Inspired by Enso, quasimodal mode makes it easier and more efficient to search for any query (although I'm not so sure about making it more 'humane'). If Quasimodal is enabled in the settings, then pressing and holding down the CapsLock key brings up the Searchy window, and releasing it searches for the query. This eliminates the need to press a hotkey, and then press enter, and is faster if you want to type short inputs. Quasimodal mode works alongside the default mode, and does not replace - so if you enable it, you can still summon Searchy using Ctrl-Space (by default) whenever you want to type longer queries.
If you want to toggle CapsLock (switch between characters being all upper-case or lower-case), you can type 'caps' as the input. An easier and faster way is to press a modifier key (Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Win) and press CapsLock at the same time. This will toggle CapsLock without bringing up Searchy.

Well, that's pretty much all you need to know about Searchy! To get a more detailed rundown of the settings, head on over to the wiki page at http://wiki.github.com/ralebaskinson/Searchy/ (now's a good time to try out 'go'!).
